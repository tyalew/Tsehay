             <h2> Traditional Ethiopian Coffee</h2>
            <p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Legends abound regarding the origin of coffee, however the majority of the available<br> data points to Ethiopia around the ninth century AD. It is reported that after his goats consumed fruit <br>from a certain tree, Kaldi, the goat herder, noticed that his goats were being more animated. <br>These berries were the ancestors of modern coffee beans.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses:</strong> After learning that caffeine has stimulating properties, people began to crush and boil the beans.<br> Coffee's capacity to boost energy, alertness, and focus led to its rapid popularity.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses in the Present:</strong> Coffee is still a popular beverage today, appreciated for its flavor, fragrance, and <br>many health advantages.</p><br>

                Fresh beans are roasted in a pot for a few minutes before being passed around, so everyone can inhale the flavorful fumes. <br>They are then ground down to a powder and placed inside a jebena, or Ethiopian coffee pot, traditionally made of clay, on top of a stove.<br>

                While the coffee is being made, itan, or frankincense, is burned to enhance the already aromatic process.<br> Once the kettle comes to a boil several times, the coffee is served in a small cup called a sini.
